SYNOPSIS
    Format your DateTime values as usual in Czech. Now also with month
    names, day names and less sugar!

DESCRIPTION
        my $fmt = DateTime::Format::Czech->new;
        my $date = DateTime->new(year => 2010, month => 6, day => 13);
        say $fmt->format_datetime($date); # 13. června 2010

ATTRIBUTES
    show_time
        Include time in the output. Off by default.

    show_date
        Include date in the output. On by default.

    show_year
        Include year in the date output (“1. 12. 2010”). Off by default.

    show_day_name
        Include day name in date output (“neděle 13. 6.”). Off by default.

    show_month_name
        Use month name instead of its number (“1. prosince 2010”). On by
        default.

    compound_format
        The "sprintf" pattern used to glue the time and date parts. The
        default value is "%s v %s" (“5. 6. v 16.30”).

METHODS
    format_date
        Takes a DateTime value, returns a string representation of its date
        part.

    format_time
        Takes a DateTime value, returns a string representation of its time
        part in 24-hour time system. Minutes are zero-padded if needed
        (“13.00”, “19.01”).

    format_datetime
        Formats a given DateTime value, returning date and time parts as
        configured by the "show_date" and "show_time" attributes. The date
        and time parts are glued together using the "compound_format"
        pattern. You can also call this method using the shorter "format"
        name.
